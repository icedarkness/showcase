### Product: EquiSecure Home Loan

**Description:**
The EquiSecure Home Loan is our flagship mortgage product, designed to provide aspiring homeowners with a stable, predictable, and affordable path to owning their dream home. We offer both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to suit different financial situations. Our dedicated loan officers provide personalized guidance from pre-approval to closing, ensuring a smooth and transparent process. As of June 2025, we prioritize applications from existing EquiBank customers.

**Key Features:**
- **Fixed-Rate Mortgage (FRM):** Lock in a consistent interest rate for the entire loan term (15 or 30 years). Ideal for buyers who prefer predictable monthly payments. Current rates for a 30-year fixed loan start at 6.75% APR for well-qualified buyers.
- **Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM):** Benefit from a lower initial interest rate for a set period (e.g., 5, 7, or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts based on market conditions. A 7/1 ARM currently starts at 6.25% APR for the initial period.
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** We offer financing up to 95% LTV for qualified first-time homebuyers, meaning you may only need a 5% down payment.
- **Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):** PMI is required for loans with less than a 20% down payment. It can be removed once you reach 20% equity in your home.
- **Fees:** Origination fees are typically 0.5% of the loan amount. Other closing costs, such as appraisal and title fees, may apply.

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):**
- **Q: What is the minimum credit score required for an EquiSecure Home Loan?**
  A: We generally look for a minimum FICO score of 680 for our conventional loans. Applicants with scores between 620 and 679 may be considered with additional compensating factors, such as a larger down payment or significant cash reserves.
- **Q: How long does the pre-approval process take?**
  A: The pre-approval process can be completed online in as little as 24-48 hours, provided you submit all the required documentation, such as proof of income, asset statements, and employment verification.
- **Q: Can I lock my interest rate?**
  A: Yes, once your loan application is approved, you can lock in your interest rate for a period of 30 to 60 days to protect you from market fluctuations while you finalize your home purchase.

- **Q: Is there a fee for balance transfers?**
  A: Yes, there is a balance transfer fee of 3% of the amount of each transfer or $5, whichever is greater. This fee is applicable even during the introductory 0% APR period.
- **Q: What credit score do I need to qualify for the VantagePoint card?**
  A: This card is designed for applicants with a good to excellent credit history, typically with a FICO score of 720 or higher.

### Product: FutureVest Investment Account

**Description:**
The FutureVest Investment Account is a flexible and accessible platform for individuals looking to grow their wealth. Whether you're saving for retirement, a major purchase, or general wealth accumulation, FutureVest offers a range of investment options, from professionally managed portfolios to self-directed trading.

**Key Features:**
- **Managed Portfolios:** Choose from a range of diversified portfolios based on your risk tolerance (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive). These portfolios are constructed using low-cost Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and are automatically rebalanced.
- **Self-Directed Trading:** Trade individual stocks and ETFs with zero commission fees. Access to real-time market data and basic research tools is included.
- **Account Types:** Available as a standard individual brokerage account, a Roth IRA, or a Traditional IRA.
- **Advisory Fee:** For Managed Portfolios, there is an annual advisory fee of 0.25% of your account balance. There are no advisory fees for self-directed trading accounts.
- **Minimum Investment:** Get started with as little as $100 for a Managed Portfolio or $0 for a self-directed account.

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):**
- **Q: What is the difference between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA?**
  A: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, meaning your qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Q: Are my investments insured?**
  A: Your investments are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which covers your account for up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for cash claims) in the event of brokerage failure. SIPC does not protect against market losses.
- **Q: How can I deposit funds into my FutureVest account?**
  A: You can easily transfer funds from a linked EquiBank checking or savings account, or from an external bank account, via electronic funds transfer (EFT).
